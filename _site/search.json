    "text": "Recently I’ve been interested in analyzing trends in electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, using data from the Alternative Fuels Data Center’s Alternative Fuel Stations database. In this first post I’ll go over retrieving the data via an API, getting it into a tidy format, and some initial analysis and visualization.\n\nI’ll retrieve the EV station data using the AFDC API. The documentation for the AFDC fuel-stations API can be found at: https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/transportation/alt-fuel-stations-v1/all/#station-count-record-fields\n\nYou can obtain a free API key at: [https://developer.nrel.gov/signup/]. I’ve saved my API key in my local .Renviron file so I can load it without exposing the key in my code.\nI will request data for all EV stations in Colorado.\nI’ll retrieve the data from the API using the httr (Wickham 2023) package.\n\n\nCode# API key is stored in my .Renviron file\napi_key &lt;- Sys.getenv(\"AFDC_KEY\")\n\n# base url for AFDC alternative fuel stations API\ntarget &lt;- \"https://developer.nrel.gov/api/alt-fuel-stations/v1\"\n\n# Return data for all electric stations in Colorado\napi_path &lt;-\".json?&fuel_type=ELEC&state=CO&limit=all\"\n\ncomplete_api_path &lt;- paste0(target,api_path,'&api_key=',api_key)\n\nresponse &lt;- httr::GET(url=complete_api_path)\n\nif (response$status_code !=200){\n print(paste('Warning, API call returned error code',response$status_code))\n}\n\nresponse$status_code\n\n[1] 200\n\n\n\nThe result returned from the API is a response object, and the data is in JSON format. The response (which I’m not printing here because would show my API key) contains a status code; a code of 200 means the API request was successful. Some of the general error codes the API might return are described here.\nI’ll use the jsonlite (Ooms 2014) package to convert the JSON to R.\n\n\nCodeev_dat &lt;- jsonlite::fromJSON(httr::content(response,\"text\"))\n\nclass(ev_dat)\n\n[1] \"list\"\n\nCodenames(ev_dat)\n\n[1] \"station_locator_url\" \"total_results\"       \"station_counts\"     \n[4] \"fuel_stations\"      \n\n\n\nThe converted response is actually a list containing the data as well as some metadata about the request.\nThe total_results field gives the total number of fuel station records match your requested query (regardless of any limit applied).\n\n\nCodeev_dat$total_results\n\n[1] 2049\n\n\n\n\nThe *station_counts* field gives a breakdown by fuel type (here I requested only electric so the counts for all other fuel types are zero).\n\ntotal includes the number of individual chargers/plugs, which is why it is greater than the station count.\nIn this case, there are 2049 stations, and a total of 4910 chargers/plugs.\n\n\n\n\nCodeev_dat$station_counts$fuels$ELEC\n\n$total\n[1] 4910\n\n$stations\n$stations$total\n[1] 2049\n\n\nFinally, the data we want to analyze is in the fuel_stations data frame.\n\nCodeev &lt;- ev_dat$fuel_stations\n\n\n\nThe returned data contains many non-electric fields that we don’t need (they will all be NA since we requested electric fuel type only), so I’ll remove the non-relevant fields from the data frame to clean things up a bit, using the starts_with function from the Wickham et al. (2023) package. - I’ll also change the date column type and add a variable for year opened, since I want to look at how many stations were opened over time.\n\nCode# filter out non-EV related fields\nev &lt;- ev %&gt;% select(-dplyr::starts_with(\"lng\")) %&gt;% \n  select(-starts_with(\"cng\")) %&gt;%\n  select(-starts_with(\"lpg\")) %&gt;%\n  select(-starts_with(\"hy\")) %&gt;% \n  select(-starts_with(\"ng\")) %&gt;% \n  select(-starts_with(\"e85\")) %&gt;% \n  select(-starts_with(\"bd\")) %&gt;% \n  select(-starts_with(\"rd\")) %&gt;% \n  filter(status_code=='E')\n\n\n# change date field to date type and add a year opened variable\nev$open_date &lt;- lubridate::ymd(ev$open_date)\nev$open_year &lt;- lubridate::year(ev$open_date)\n\ncolnames(ev)\n\n [1] \"access_code\"                \"access_days_time\"          \n [3] \"access_detail_code\"         \"cards_accepted\"            \n [5] \"date_last_confirmed\"        \"expected_date\"             \n [7] \"fuel_type_code\"             \"groups_with_access_code\"   \n [9] \"id\"                         \"open_date\"                 \n[11] \"owner_type_code\"            \"status_code\"               \n[13] \"restricted_access\"          \"maximum_vehicle_class\"     \n[15] \"station_name\"               \"station_phone\"             \n[17] \"updated_at\"                 \"facility_type\"             \n[19] \"geocode_status\"             \"latitude\"                  \n[21] \"longitude\"                  \"city\"                      \n[23] \"intersection_directions\"    \"plus4\"                     \n[25] \"state\"                      \"street_address\"            \n[27] \"zip\"                        \"country\"                   \n[29] \"ev_connector_types\"         \"ev_dc_fast_num\"            \n[31] \"ev_level1_evse_num\"         \"ev_level2_evse_num\"        \n[33] \"ev_network\"                 \"ev_network_web\"            \n[35] \"ev_other_evse\"              \"ev_pricing\"                \n[37] \"ev_renewable_source\"        \"nps_unit_name\"             \n[39] \"access_days_time_fr\"        \"intersection_directions_fr\"\n[41] \"groups_with_access_code_fr\" \"ev_pricing_fr\"             \n[43] \"ev_network_ids\"             \"federal_agency\"            \n[45] \"open_year\"                 \n\n\n\n\n\nFirst I’d like to look at how many EV stations opened over time, so I’ll make a new data frame summarizing the number of stations opened by year.\n\nCodeev_opened &lt;- ev %&gt;% \n  count(open_year,name = \"nopened\")  %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(open_year))\n\nhead(ev_opened)\n\n  open_year nopened\n1      2010       2\n2      2011      13\n3      2012      30\n4      2013      18\n5      2014      35\n6      2015      57\n\n\n\n\nCodeev_opened %&gt;% ggplot(aes(open_year, nopened)) + \n  geom_col()+\n  xlab(\"Year Opened\")+\n  ylab(\"# Stations Opened\")+\n  ggtitle('EV Stations Opened in Colorado Each Year')+\n  theme_grey(base_size = 15)+\n  geom_text(aes(label = nopened), vjust = 0)\n\n\n\nNumber of EV Charging Stations Opend In Colorado\n\n\n\n\nWe can also look at the cumulative sum of stations opened over time\n\nCode#| fig-width: 8\n\nev_opened %&gt;% ggplot(aes(open_year,cumsum(nopened)))+\n  geom_line(linewidth=1.5)+\n  geom_point()+\n  xlab(\"Year\")+\n  ylab(\"# Stations\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Cumulative sum of EV stations opened in CO\")+\n  theme_grey(base_size = 15)\n\n\n\n\n\nNext I want to dig a little deeper and break down the station openings by charger type and/or level. I’d expect to see more Level 2 chargers in earlier years, and an increase in DC fast charging stations in more recent years. I’ll make a new data frame with the number of chargers opened by year, grouped by charging level (Level 1, Level 2, or DC fast).\n\n\nNote here I’m working with the number of chargers of each level, not the number of stations.\n\n\nCodeev_opened_level &lt;- ev %&gt;% \n  select(id,open_date,\n         open_year,\n         ev_dc_fast_num,\n         ev_level2_evse_num,ev_level1_evse_num) %&gt;%\n  group_by(open_year) %&gt;%\n  summarize(n_DC=sum(ev_dc_fast_num,na.rm = TRUE), \n            n_L2=sum(ev_level2_evse_num,na.rm = TRUE),\n            n_L1=sum(ev_level1_evse_num,na.rm = TRUE) ) %&gt;% \n  filter(!is.na(open_year))\n\nhead(ev_opened_level)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 4\n  open_year  n_DC  n_L2  n_L1\n      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt;\n1      2010     1    21    18\n2      2011     1    17     0\n3      2012     9    41     0\n4      2013    20    31    28\n5      2014    24    62     0\n6      2015    29   127     0\n\n\nTo make plotting easier, I’ll pivot the dataframe from wide to long format so I can group by charging level:\n\nCodeev_opened_level_long &lt;- ev_opened_level %&gt;% \n  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols=c('n_DC','n_L2','n_L1'),\n                      names_to = \"Level\",\n                      names_prefix = \"n_\",\n                      values_to = \"n_opened\")\n\nhead(ev_opened_level_long)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n  open_year Level n_opened\n      &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1      2010 DC           1\n2      2010 L2          21\n3      2010 L1          18\n4      2011 DC           1\n5      2011 L2          17\n6      2011 L1           0\n\n\nNow I can go ahead and plot the number of chargers opened over time, by level.\n\nCode#| fig-width: 8\n\nev_opened_level_long %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(open_year, n_opened, group=Level)) +\n  geom_line(aes(col=Level), linewidth=1.5)+\n  geom_point(aes(col=Level))+\n  xlab(\"Year Opened\")+\n  ylab(\"# Charges Opened\")+\n  ggtitle(\"Number of Chargers Opened Per Year By Level\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCodesessionInfo()\n\nR version 4.2.3 (2023-03-15)\nPlatform: x86_64-apple-darwin17.0 (64-bit)\nRunning under: macOS Big Sur ... 10.16\n\nMatrix products: default\nBLAS:   /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2/Resources/lib/libRblas.0.dylib\nLAPACK: /Library/Frameworks/R.framework/Versions/4.2/Resources/lib/libRlapack.dylib\n\nlocale:\n[1] en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8/C/en_US.UTF-8/en_US.UTF-8\n\nattached base packages:\n[1] stats     graphics  grDevices datasets  utils     methods   base     \n\nother attached packages:\n[1] dplyr_1.1.2    ggplot2_3.4.2  jsonlite_1.8.5 httr_1.4.6    \n\nloaded via a namespace (and not attached):\n [1] pillar_1.9.0     compiler_4.2.3   tools_4.2.3      digest_0.6.31   \n [5] lubridate_1.9.2  evaluate_0.21    lifecycle_1.0.3  tibble_3.2.1    \n [9] gtable_0.3.3     timechange_0.2.0 pkgconfig_2.0.3  rlang_1.1.1     \n[13] cli_3.6.1        rstudioapi_0.14  curl_5.0.1       yaml_2.3.7      \n[17] xfun_0.39        fastmap_1.1.1    withr_2.5.0      knitr_1.43      \n[21] generics_0.1.3   vctrs_0.6.2      grid_4.2.3       tidyselect_1.2.0\n[25] glue_1.6.2       R6_2.5.1         fansi_1.0.4      rmarkdown_2.22  \n[29] purrr_1.0.1      tidyr_1.3.0      farver_2.1.1     magrittr_2.0.3  \n[33] scales_1.2.1     htmltools_0.5.5  colorspace_2.1-0 renv_0.17.3     \n[37] labeling_0.4.2   utf8_1.2.3       munsell_0.5.0"

I’m interested to see what progress has been made in transitioning to more renewable/low-carbon fuels for electricity generation.\nConveniently, the data already contain fields for the share of total electricity generation for each fuel type! I’ll make a new data frame with just these fields. I can select these columns (all ending in share_elec), using the ends_with function from the Wickham et al.

What I want to do is give a single plot command and group/color the lines by the variable (fuel type). To achieve this, I am going to pivot the data frame from wide to long format.

We can see that the share of fossil fuels and coal has decreased, and renewable have increased. But there’s a lot on this plot and it’s hard to read, so I’ll focus down on some more specific subsets of the data.\n\nFirst we can look at the total shares of fossil (oil,coal, gas), renewable (wind, solar, hydro), and nuclear generation. Grouping into these categories de-clutters the plot and makes it easier to interpret.\n\nCodeusa %&gt;% select(year,fossil_share_elec,renewables_share_elec,nuclear_share_elec) %&gt;% \n  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols=dplyr::ends_with('share_elec'),\n               names_to='FuelType',\n               values_to = 'Percentage') %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(year,Percentage))+\n  geom_line(aes(color=FuelType),linewidth=1.5)+\n  ggtitle(\"Percent of US electricity Generation\")+\n  xlab(\"Year\")+\n  ylab(\"Percent\")\n\n\n\n\nObservations from this plot:\n\nFossil fuel share has been decreasing steadily since about 2007\nRenewable share has been increasing steadily since about 2007\nNuclear has remained relatively constant at around 20%.\nFossil share remains the majority of generation, but is decreasing.

Coal was much higher than gas previously, but their shares became equal around 2015 and gas now makes up a larger share of the fossil fuel generation.\n\n\nIn this dataset, renewables include wind, solar, and hydro.\n\n\nCodeusa %&gt;% select(year,renewables_share_elec,solar_share_elec,\n               hydro_share_elec,wind_share_elec) %&gt;% \n  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols=dplyr::ends_with('share_elec'),\n               names_to='FuelType',\n               values_to = 'Percentage') %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(year,Percentage))+\n  geom_line(aes(color=FuelType),linewidth=1.5)+\n  ggtitle(\"Percent of US electricity Generation: Renewables\")+\n  xlab(\"Year\")+\n  ylab(\"Percent\")\n\n\n\n\nObservations from this plot:\n\nThe share of renewable electricity production has increased sharply, approximately doubling from 2008 to 2020.\nThe share of hydro generation has remained relatively constant.\n\nSolar and wind shares have increased significantly.\n\nWind started to increase earlier, around 2005.\nSolar started increasing around 2012"

We need to reduce carbon emissionsIn order to prevent or mitigate the effects of climate change, and electricity generation is a large component of these emissions. I’m interested to see what progress has been made in transitioning to more renewable/low-carbon fuels for electricity generation.\nConveniently, the data already contain fields for the share of total electricity generation for each fuel type! I’ll make a new data frame with just these fields. I can select these columns (all ending in share_elec), using the ends_with function from the Wickham et al. (2023) package.\n\nCodeusa %&gt;% select(year,dplyr::ends_with('share_elec')) %&gt;% \n  head()\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 13\n   year biofuel_share_elec coal_share_elec fossil_share_elec gas_share_elec\n  &lt;dbl&gt;              &lt;dbl&gt;           &lt;dbl&gt;             &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  2000               1.60            51.7              70.9           16.2\n2  2001               1.34            51.1              71.9           17.1\n3  2002               1.40            50.3              71.0           18.0\n4  2003               1.38            51.0              71.2           16.8\n5  2004               1.36            50.1              71.3           18.0\n6  2005               1.34            49.9              71.9           18.9\n# ℹ 8 more variables: hydro_share_elec &lt;dbl&gt;, low_carbon_share_elec &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   nuclear_share_elec &lt;dbl&gt;, oil_share_elec &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   other_renewables_share_elec &lt;dbl&gt;, renewables_share_elec &lt;dbl&gt;,\n#   solar_share_elec &lt;dbl&gt;, wind_share_elec &lt;dbl&gt;\n\n\nNow I have a dataframe with just the variables I want to plot, but the format isn’t ideal; I would have to specify/plot each variable separately. What I want to do is give a single plot command and group/color the lines by the variable (fuel type). To achieve this, I am going to pivot the data frame from wide to long format. I believe this was previously referred to as gather or melt.\n\nCodeusa_share &lt;- usa %&gt;% select(year,ends_with('share_elec')) %&gt;% \n  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols=ends_with('share_elec'),\n                      names_to='FuelType',\n                      values_to = 'Percentage')\nhead(usa_share)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 3\n   year FuelType              Percentage\n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;                      &lt;dbl&gt;\n1  2000 biofuel_share_elec          1.60\n2  2000 coal_share_elec            51.7 \n3  2000 fossil_share_elec          70.9 \n4  2000 gas_share_elec             16.2 \n5  2000 hydro_share_elec            7.10\n6  2000 low_carbon_share_elec      29.1 \n\n\nNow my dataframe has a row for each year, fuel type, and value, and I can simply group or color by the fuel type when I plot.\n\nCodeusa_share %&gt;% \n  ggplot(aes(year,Percentage))+\n  geom_line(aes(color=FuelType),linewidth=1.5)+\n  ggtitle(\"Percent of US electricity Generation By Fuel type\")+\n  xlab(\"Year\")+\n  ylab(\"Percent\")\n\n\n\nTimeseries of the percent of total US electricty generation by fuel type.\n\n\n\nHere we finally have a plot of the share of electricity generation by fuel type. We can see that the share of fossil fuels and coal has decreased, and renewable have increased. But there’s a lot on this plot and it’s hard to read, so I’ll focus down on some more specific subsets of the data.\n\nFirst we can look at the total shares of fossil (oil,coal, gas), renewable (wind, solar, hydro), and nuclear generation.
