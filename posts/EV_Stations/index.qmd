# Introduction

Recently I've been interested in analyzing trends in electric vehicle (EV) charging stations, using data from the [Alternative Fuels Data Center](https://afdc.energy.gov/)'s Alternative Fuel Stations [database](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/transportation/alt-fuel-stations-v1/). In this first post I'll go over retrieving the data via an API, getting it into a tidy format, and some initial analysis and visualization.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r Load Libraries, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

library(httr)
library(jsonlite)
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_grey(base_size = 15))
library(dplyr)

```

## Data

I'll retrieve the EV station data using the AFDC API. The documentation for the AFDC fuel-stations API can be found at: <https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/transportation/alt-fuel-stations-v1/all/#station-count-record-fields>

-   You can obtain a free API key at: \[<https://developer.nrel.gov/signup/>\]. I've saved my API key in my local .Renviron file so I can load it without exposing the key in my code.

    ::: callout-tip
    I find the easiest way to store an API key in your .Renviron file is with the *usethis* [@usethis] package. Simply call the `usethis::edit_r_environ()` function to open the .Renviron file, add your key in the form *API_KEY="xxxxx"*, and save. After you restart R, you will be able to load the key in your code using `Sys.getenv("API_KEY")`.
    :::

-   I will request data for all EV stations in **Colorado**.

-   I'll retrieve the data from the API using the *httr* [@httr] package.

```{r Load Data from API}

# API key is stored in my .Renviron file
api_key <- Sys.getenv("AFDC_KEY")

# base url for AFDC alternative fuel stations API
target <- "https://developer.nrel.gov/api/alt-fuel-stations/v1"

# Return data for all electric stations in Colorado
api_path <- ".json?&fuel_type=ELEC&state=CO&limit=all"

complete_api_path <- paste0(target,api_path,'&api_key=',api_key)

response <- httr::GET(url = complete_api_path)

if (response$status_code != 200) {
 print(paste('Warning, API call returned error code',response$status_code))
}

print(paste("Data last downloaded on", response$date, "with response code of",response$status_code))


```

-   The result returned from the API is a *response* object, and the data is in JSON format. The response (which I'm not printing here because would show my API key) contains a [status code](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/); a code of 200 means the API request was successful. Some of the general error codes the API might return are described [here](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/errors/).

-   I'll use the *jsonlite* [@jsonlite] package to convert the JSON to R.

```{r}

ev_dat <- jsonlite::fromJSON(httr::content(response,"text"))

class(ev_dat)
names(ev_dat)
```

-   The converted response is actually a list containing the data as well as some metadata about the request.

-   The *total_results* field gives the total number of fuel station records that match your requested query (regardless of any limit applied).

```{r}
ev_dat$total_results
```

-   The \*[station_counts](https://developer.nrel.gov/docs/transportation/alt-fuel-stations-v1/all/#station-count-record-fields)\* field gives a breakdown by fuel type (here I requested only electric so the counts for all other fuel types are zero).

    -   *total* includes the number of individual chargers/plugs, which is why it is greater than the station count.

    -   In this case, there are `r ev_dat$station_counts$fuels$ELEC$stations$total` stations, and a total of `r ev_dat$station_counts$fuels$ELEC$total` chargers/plugs.

```{r}
ev_dat$station_counts$fuels$ELEC

```

Finally, the data we want to analyze is in the *fuel_stations* data frame.

```{r}

ev <- ev_dat$fuel_stations

```

### Filter out non-EV data columns

The returned data contains many non-electric fields that we don't need (they will all be NA since we requested electric fuel type only), so I'll remove the non-relevant fields from the data frame to clean things up a bit, using the *starts_with* function from the *dplyr* [@dplyr] package.

I'll also change the date column type and add a variable for year opened, since I want to look at how many stations were opened over time.

```{r remove fields}

# filter out non-EV related fields
ev <- ev %>% select(-dplyr::starts_with("lng")) %>% 
  select(-starts_with("cng")) %>%
  select(-starts_with("lpg")) %>%
  select(-starts_with("hy")) %>% 
  select(-starts_with("ng")) %>% 
  select(-starts_with("e85")) %>% 
  select(-starts_with("bd")) %>% 
  select(-starts_with("rd")) %>% 
  filter(status_code == 'E') |>
  select(-ends_with("_fr")) # drop french language columns


# change date field to date type and add a year opened variable
ev$open_date <- lubridate::ymd(ev$open_date)
ev$open_year <- lubridate::year(ev$open_date)


```

## Analysis

### Station Openings Over Time

#### How many stations opened each year?

First I'd like to look at how many EV stations opened over time, so I'll make a new data frame summarizing the number of stations opened by year.

```{r }
#| label: tbl-nopened-per-year
#| tbl-cap: "Number of charging stations opened per year."

ev_opened <- ev %>% 
  count(open_year,name = "nopened")  %>% 
  filter(!is.na(open_year)) 

ev_opened |>
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5))

```

```{r }
#| label: fig-nopened-bar
#| fig-width: 8
#| fig-cap: Number of EV Charging Stations Opened In Colorado each year
#| 

ev_opened %>% ggplot(aes(open_year, nopened)) + 
  geom_col() +
  xlab("Year Opened") +
  ylab("# Stations Opened") +
  ggtitle('EV Stations Opened in Colorado Each Year',subtitle = paste("Data downloaded on", response$date)) +
  theme_grey(base_size = 15) +
  geom_text(aes(label = nopened), vjust = 0)

```

#### Cumulative sum of stations opened over time

We can also look at the cumulative sum of stations opened over time

```{r}
#| label: fig-nopen-cumsum
#| fig-cap: "Cumulative sum of EV stations opened in CO"
#| fig-width: 8

ev_opened %>% ggplot(aes(open_year,cumsum(nopened))) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 1.5) +
  xlab("Year") +
  ylab("# Stations") +
  ggtitle("Cumulative sum of EV stations opened in CO") +
  theme_grey(base_size = 15)

```

### Station openings by level/charger type

Next I want to dig a little deeper and break down the station openings by charger type and/or level. I'd expect to see more Level 2 chargers in earlier years, and an increase in DC fast charging stations in more recent years. I'll make a new data frame with the number of chargers opened by year, grouped by charging level (Level 1, Level 2, or DC fast).

-   *Note* here I'm working with the number of *chargers* of each level, not the number of *stations*.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-ev-opened-by-level
#| tbl-cap: "Number of EV chargers opened per year, by charging level"

ev_opened_level <- ev %>% 
  select(id,open_date,
         open_year,
         ev_dc_fast_num,
         ev_level2_evse_num,ev_level1_evse_num) %>%
  group_by(open_year) %>%
  summarize(n_DC = sum(ev_dc_fast_num,na.rm = TRUE), 
            n_L2 = sum(ev_level2_evse_num,na.rm = TRUE),
            n_L1 = sum(ev_level1_evse_num,na.rm = TRUE) ) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(open_year))

ev_opened_level |>
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5))

```

To make plotting easier, I'll pivot the dataframe from wide to long format so I can group by charging level:

```{r}
#| label: tbl-ev-opened-by-level-long
#| tbl-cap: "Number of EV chargers opened per year by charging level, in long format for plotting."


ev_opened_level_long <- ev_opened_level %>% 
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = c('n_DC','n_L2','n_L1'),
                      names_to = "Level",
                      names_prefix = "n_",
                      values_to = "n_opened")

ev_opened_level_long |>
  DT::datatable(rownames = FALSE, options = list(pageLength = 5))


```

Now I can go ahead and plot the number of chargers opened over time, by level.

```{r }
#| label: fig-nopened-level
#| fig-cap: "Number of Chargers Opened Per Year By Level"

g <- ev_opened_level_long %>% 
  ggplot(aes(open_year, n_opened, group = Level)) +
  geom_line(aes(col = Level), linewidth = 1.5) +
  geom_point(aes(col = Level), size = 4) +
  xlab("Year Opened") +
  ylab("# Charges Opened") +
  ggtitle("Number of Chargers Opened Per Year By Level")
  
plotly::ggplotly(g)

```
