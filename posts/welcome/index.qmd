Welcome to my (new) data science portfolio and blog, made with [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio/).

If you're interested in setting up your own Quarto website or blog, I highly recommend watching this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtSFXtDf4cM) by [Deepsha Menghan](https://deepshamenghani.quarto.pub/dmenghani/)i.

You can still view my previous [blog](https://andypicke.github.io/); I am in the process of figuring out how/if I will move that content here.
