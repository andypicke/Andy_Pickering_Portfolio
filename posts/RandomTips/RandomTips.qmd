# Introduction

A list of sort of random things I am writing down becuase they might be useful to other people (and because I will forget them).

# The list:

## Make a list of all the links on a webpage

```{r}

library(rvest)

get_all_links <- function(page_url) {
  
  # read the html from the website 
  html <- rvest::read_html(page_url)
  
  # create a list of all the hyperlinks on the website
  links <- rvest::html_attr(rvest::html_nodes(html, "a"), "href")
}

links <- get_all_links("https://andypicke.quarto.pub/portfolio/blog.html")

```
